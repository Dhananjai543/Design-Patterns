# Behavioural Design Patterns

What are Behavioural Design Patterns?
1. Behavioural design patterns are design patterns that deal with object collaboration and delegation of responsibilities. These patterns are concerned with how objects interact with each other and how to encapsulate the interaction in separate objects.
2. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication between objects and make the system easy to maintain and extend.
