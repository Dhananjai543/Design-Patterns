Iterator Design Pattern

1. Iterator allows a way to access elements/children of an aggregate object in sequence while hiding the actual internal data structure used.
2. In Java, iterators are integral part of collections framework as they are implementations of this design pattern.
3. Iterators are stateful, meaning an iterator object remembers its position while iterating.
