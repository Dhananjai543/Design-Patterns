# Structural Design Patterns

What are Structural Design Patterns?
1. Structural design patterns are design patterns that deal with object composition and relationships between objects. These patterns help in ensuring that if one part of a system changes, the entire system does not need to do the same.
2. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication between objects and make the system easy to maintain and extend.
3. Structural design patterns are further divided into class-creation patterns and object-structural patterns.
