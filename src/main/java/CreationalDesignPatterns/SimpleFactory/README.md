The simple factory is essentially a class that, based on a given input, returns objects of different types.

Simple Factory Pattern is a Factory class in its simplest form. In simple factory pattern, we have a factory class which has a method that returns different types of object based on given input.


Summary
1. In conclusion, the two ideas you have to bear in mind are:
2. The simple factory is not a real pattern.
3. The simple factory is just the concrete factory, without the extra factory class abstraction found in either the factory method or abstract factory.

Use cases of Simple Factory Pattern:
1. **Object Creation**: The Simple Factory pattern is used when the object creation logic needs to be abstracted from the client code. It allows the client to create objects without knowing the specific class or constructor to use.
2. **Decoupling**: The Simple Factory pattern helps in decoupling the client code from the concrete classes being instantiated. This allows for easier maintenance and extension of the codebase.
