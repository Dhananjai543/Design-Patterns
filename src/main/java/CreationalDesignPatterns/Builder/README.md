The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that is widely used in object-oriented programming to construct complex objects step by step. This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. In Java, the Builder pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have a large number of optional parameters or configurations.

Understanding the Builder Pattern
The Builder pattern involves the following key components:

Product: This is the complex object that needs to be created. It often has numerous optional parameters.

Builder: This interface defines the steps to construct the product. Each step is typically represented by a method in the interface.

ConcreteBuilder: This class implements the Builder interface and provides the specific implementations for each step of the construction process.

Director: This class orchestrates the construction process by invoking the methods on the builder interface. It is not required, but it helps in providing a more fluent and consistent way to construct objects.

Client: The client is responsible for creating the director and configuring it with a specific concrete builder to construct the product.

Use cases of the Builder Pattern:
1. **Complex Object Creation**: The Builder pattern is used when the construction of a complex object involves multiple steps and configurations. It allows the client to specify the desired configuration without having to know the internal details of the construction process.
2. **Fluent Interface**: The Builder pattern is often used to create fluent interfaces, where method calls can be chained together to configure the object in a more readable and expressive way.
3. **Immutable Objects**: The Builder pattern is commonly used to create immutable objects, where the object's state cannot be modified after construction. This is achieved by making the product class immutable and only allowing configuration through the builder interface.
4. **Variability in Object Creation**: The Builder pattern allows for different representations of the same complex object to be created using the same construction process. This is useful when the same object needs to be created with different configurations or parameters, in different order.
5. **Parameterized Constructors**: The Builder pattern is an alternative to using parameterized constructors with a large number of optional parameters. It provides a more flexible and readable way to construct objects with optional parameters.
