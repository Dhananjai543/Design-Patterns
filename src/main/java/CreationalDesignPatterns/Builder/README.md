The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that is widely used in object-oriented programming to construct complex objects step by step. This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. In Java, the Builder pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have a large number of optional parameters or configurations.

Understanding the Builder Pattern
The Builder pattern involves the following key components:

Product: This is the complex object that needs to be created. It often has numerous optional parameters.

Builder: This interface defines the steps to construct the product. Each step is typically represented by a method in the interface.

ConcreteBuilder: This class implements the Builder interface and provides the specific implementations for each step of the construction process.

Director: This class orchestrates the construction process by invoking the methods on the builder interface. It is not required, but it helps in providing a more fluent and consistent way to construct objects.

Client: The client is responsible for creating the director and configuring it with a specific concrete builder to construct the product.
